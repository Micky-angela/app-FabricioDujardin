# README

The financial market shiny app is a simplistic version of the power of financial analysis through R. As the app is straight forward I will just mention what it does:

* display graphic of the stock time series selected

There is a lot that can be improved however it is very tedious and time consuming. This is already to my eyes a great way to show the power of shiny and R coupled with great packages.

Let me know if you have any links of other shiny apps that are similar or having further functionalities as I would be more than happy to look into the code.
